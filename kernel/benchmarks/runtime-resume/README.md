# runtime-resume — the resurrection probe

One question, no fixes: **after the process that built a session exits, what can
a new process still prove about that session's runtime semantics without asking
a model?**

The measurement boundary is the OS process. Nil-ing an `Agent` or a `Session`
leaves package-level singletons, live sinks, registries and caches standing, any
of which can revive state that would not have survived a real restart. Each
phase here is a child process that exits before the next one starts.

```
process A (construct)          process B (resume)
  boot a real runtime            boot a real runtime
  drive turns (scripted)         sessionstore.LoadSession(path)
  set a durable Goal             ctrl.Resume(session, path)
  fold the context               read host state
  record what it sees            record what it sees
  EXIT                           EXIT
```

Between them an arm may run a **lever**: a production-reachable change, never a
poked field.

## Running it

```bash
go run ./benchmarks/runtime-resume                      # all arms, temp roots
go run ./benchmarks/runtime-resume -only exact -keep    # one arm, keep the roots
go run ./benchmarks/runtime-resume -json matrix.json    # machine-readable too
```

No network and no key: the provider is a deterministic script in-process. Each
arm demands a clean root — a reused one puts a lever's effect into the construct
phase, which then reads as "the lever changed nothing".

## Phase B never calls a model

This is the point of the probe, not an optimisation. If phase B ran a turn, a
model could reconstruct a lost step id or goal from the transcript and the row
would go green while the host had in fact forgotten it. Phase B boots, loads,
inspects, and stops — so every PASS means *the host can prove this before a
provider call*.

## The delegation matrix

What the arms below establish, frozen. Every surface that spawns a child belongs
to one of two classes, and a class is a contract about what a run leaves behind
rather than a family resemblance.

| execution class | scheduler | Graph | journal | store | lineage | restart |
| --- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| `task` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | after STARTED | the call | ✓ |
| `fleet` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | after STARTED | the call | ✓ |
| `parallel_tasks` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | after STARTED | the call | ✓ |
| `run_skill` **(model-invoked)** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | after STARTED | the call | ✓ |
| `run_skill` **(host-initiated)** | ✓ | ✓ root | ✓ | after STARTED | **none** | ✓ |
| `read_only_task` | ✓ | — | — | — | — | — |
| `read_only_skill` | ✓ | — | — | — | — | — |

The dashes are a promise, not a gap. An ephemeral run asks the same scheduler and
holds real capacity; what it declines to do is claim anything a snapshot cannot
justify, because the graph projects durable facts and it writes none.

The two `run_skill` rows are one execution class with two lineages. A model
delegated the first from a tool call, so its execution and its parent call are
one string. A person started the second, so it descends from nothing: its
execution is the host's own, it draws a **root** node with no spawn edge above
it, and its parent call stays empty. `SubagentMeta` carries both answers, and
this is the first place they differ — until a host-started run existed, every
durable execution came from a tool call and one field could hold both.

`TestDelegationClassesStayApart` in `internal/assembly/boot` holds the classification, and
holds it where a completed run cannot: what the store answers at the one instant
a child is inside the provider. A check made afterwards cannot tell a recorded
execution from an unrecorded one that happened to finish, because completion
writes a record either way. Two mutations are runnable against it — an ephemeral
entry point that opens a delegation again, and a fan-out item that skips the
store — and each turns exactly the rows that would drift red.

The evidence for every cell is the arms in this probe, not that test. It freezes
the classification; they are what established it.

### Reading a record older than the separation

A stored child names its own execution now. One written before that did is
aliased to its parent call **only** where the journal opened an execution by
exactly that id — the journal is what confirms that the older writer used one id
for both, and a parent id alone proves only what it meant by lineage. A record
whose parent names no execution stays unknown and is joined on by nothing: a
single task once stored the call while the journal opened the node, and a prefix
rule would have joined those two wrong.

Nothing is rewritten. The safe legacy subset resolves losslessly on read, and the
unsafe one — a host-started record from before this, which never had an execution
to name — cannot be recovered by any rule that is not inventing history. Reads
stay lenient about them forever; writes are strict, because a new record with no
execution is the one shape no later reader can place.

### What a worker owes when it finishes

`run_skill(review)` required a typed verdict and `task(profile=review)` did not,
and asking why the second lacked it was the wrong question: the requirement had
no owner to inherit from. Neither `skill.Skill` nor `agent.ProfileDefinition`
could express it — checked over the types, so a field added later is caught — and
what remained was a switch on the worker's *name*. The cross-wiring showed the
name was the whole of it: an ordinary worker that borrowed it acquired the
obligation, and the reviewer renamed lost it.

So the tempting fix was the defect. `if worker.Name == "review"` in the task
compiler would have put the same undeclared derivation in a second place and made
the accident look like a design.

A worker now declares what it owes. `DeliveryContract` lives on the definition,
projects into the execution spec, and both entry points read only the projection:

| | contract | before | now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `run_skill(review)` | declared | required | required |
| `task(profile=review)` | declared | none | **required** |
| a reviewer under another name | declared | none | **required** |
| an ordinary worker named `review` | none | required | **none** |

The last two rows are the point. This fixed two independent errors — a real
reviewer that lost its obligation by being renamed, and an ordinary worker that
gained one by borrowing a word — and `task(profile=review)` changing behaviour is
a consequence of moving the rule from wording to structure, not the goal.

> **Delivery obligations are declared by the worker, projected into the
> execution spec, and enforced independently of invocation surface or names.**

### Open, and deliberately not closed here

**Third-party delivery declarations.** `DeliveryContract` is set by the built-in
definitions and is not parsed from user frontmatter. Whether a third-party
profile may declare that it produces a system-recognised typed verdict is a
question about permission, not about where the fact lives — and if a security
verdict ever counts as verification evidence, a line of YAML should not be enough
to claim it. Settling that is separate from having settled the ownership.

The three lever arms all append after the fold on purpose. Without it the
projection is already gone at the boundary for an unrelated reason, and the
lever's own effect cannot be read out of the result.

`refold-into-body` is the discovery arm rather than a red one. The second fold
reads the provider-visible view — stored body plus live tail — and has to write
a boundary back in canonical terms, which the body has no counterpart for. What
it can lose is the part of the body past the new boundary, so the arm carries an
oracle rather than a comparison.

The tail arms exist as a pair on purpose. A tail change reaching the
transcript and the same change driven through `Controller.Rewind` are different
paths, and only one of them consults coverage; separating them is what says
whether a red belongs to the validity rule or to the caller that discards the
projection before the rule is asked.

`covered-rewind` targets a middle checkpoint rather than the first. Rewinding
to the first empties the conversation, and a session holding only a system row
is not persisted at all, so the restart would read back the transcript the arm
had removed — a different rule answering instead of the one under test.

`system-swap` pins its fact deliberately: only a **pinned body** rides the
stable prefix. The saved-fact index is retrieval-only and reached through the
`memory` tool, so a relevant-activation fact moves nothing.

## The lone-delegation arms

A lone `task` is not a second executor. It reaches the same `RunProfileSpec` a
fleet item does, asks the same scheduler for a slot, and — since the live graph
was unified — draws a node through the same publication. So the question these
four ask is not "does a single task have a graph". It is: **where does that
shared chain stop being wired to the durable authority the fan-out arms
established?**

They separate the four deaths that can answer differently. A delegation that
finished in a turn that closed loses nothing to interruption, so what it cannot
say afterwards was never durable at all. One killed mid-execution is the
fan-out arms' death, one entry point over. And the two background arms are the
ones the foreground cannot stand in for: a backgrounded run hands its execution
to a job and asks for a slot *inside* it, so the parent tool call has already
returned when the refusal happens, and the terminal belongs to the job rather
than to the caller.

Every row is filtered to the delegation under measurement. The queued arm fills
its ceiling with a fan-out, and a fan-out records everything — the same journal,
the same scheduler, the same session — so that fleet rides along as the arm's
positive control: whatever these rows report missing is missing at the entry
point, not in the machinery.

Four more ask who owns an ending. The boundary is the slot grant, and it is the
whole answer: an execution the scheduler never admitted produced nothing, so the
sub-agent store is owed no terminal for it, while one that ran owns its own —
completed, failed or cancelled. Both halves are read against each other in a row
that refuses the combination neither layer may produce, a child record for work
the journal proves never started. A state comparison shows that only as
"cancelled came back failed"; naming it as a store asked to speak for an
execution that never happened is what points at the cause.

The two foreground arms are stopped through the turn's own cancel and the two
background ones through the job list and a kill, which is what a person reaches
for in each case.

A stop has an owner before it has an effect, and the arms name it. A turn the
controller admitted itself — what `Send` opens, and what a person's Stop reaches
— is cancelled by `Controller.Cancel`. A synchronous `Run(ctx)` is never
admitted through that gate, so the controller holds no cancel for it and the
caller's own context holds the only one. `cancel-headless-owner` asserts both
halves, because a controller that started claiming the second would be taking
ownership from the only holder that has it. Reading one surface with the other's
stop is how the first version of this probe reported a cancellation defect that
was an ownership boundary: `Running()` answers for the gate, and a turn the gate
was never told about reads as ended the whole time.

Three read both trees at once, because "the work stopped" and "the stop reached
it" are different claims and only the pair of them says which happened. Each
reading keeps five facts apart at one instant: the turn's gate, the job's own
liveness, whether the child's context closed, whether its call returned, and
what the durable record says. A context that closed and a call that returned are
separate events — work whose caller stopped waiting leaves the same absence
behind as work that was cancelled, and only the first is a cancellation.

The three expectations are deliberately opposite, which is what makes them a
matrix rather than three tests:

```
                     turn      job        child ctx    record
parent stop (fg)     ends      —          closes       settled
parent stop (bg)     ends      running    open         still open
the job's own stop   active    gone       closes       settled
```

A fix that closed everything on a stop would satisfy the first row and violate
the third. The manager's own root needs no separate question: a job still
running with its child's context open is the root answering directly, and an
extra experiment there would only add a mechanism the probe would have to
explain when it failed.

Two more ask where a stop goes, and they are a pair on purpose. A turn that
returns while the work it owned is still running has not cancelled anything — it
has stopped waiting, which looks identical from outside until a restart reads
the record and calls the leftover an interruption. `cancel-ordinary-tool` runs a
plain shell so the answer cannot be blamed on how a delegation derives its
context, and `cancel-background-handoff` is the negative control that bounds any
fix: work already handed to a job has an owner of its own, and a stop that
reached into it would take back the handoff. A fix that cancels everything a
session knows about passes the first and fails the second.

The delegation arms carry the same question as an invariant rather than a
premise: once the turn has ended, nothing it owned may still be open. An open
record implies a live owner — nothing else closes one — so the child's own
liveness is evidence in the reading, not the test.

One of the five asks about now rather than about a restart.
`task-foreground-queued` fills the ceiling first, so the scheduler has to refuse
the delegation admission, and the arm then reads what the picture says while
that is true. A graph and a parent status are claims about the present: a
restart cannot correct one, because by then it describes a moment nobody can
observe again. The premise is established from two sides — the fan-out holding
the ceiling has `queued=slots` on disk, and the delegation's own child never
reached the provider — and the arm settles for two seconds before dying, so a
child that was merely slow to start is not read as one the scheduler held.

The identity row is the one that decides how much Step 8 can cost. Four
spellings are in play — the live node, the call it hangs under, the parent the
sub-agent store recorded, and the execution a journal would open — and if they
are already one identity, nothing here needs a new one invented for it.

`read_only_task` is deliberately out of scope: it declares itself ephemeral and
carries no durable host side effects, so demanding a journal entry from it would
break a contract rather than close a gap.

## The active-store arm

This one asks nothing about a restart. It asks whether the sub-agent store can
be asked about an execution that is happening: the journal proves the scheduler
granted the slot, the child proves it reached the provider, and the store is the
only surface `list_subagents`, `read_subagent_result` and `adopt_ref` read. An
execution missing from it is missing from every recovery path a person or a
model has, whether or not a process ever dies.

It is deliberately not a parity arm. "The fan-out differs from the lone task"
would be a finding about two code paths, and closing it would be cosmetic. What
is measured instead is one store answering differently about executions it holds
the same evidence for, by which entry point opened them.

One death holds four populations, and they are read off the journal rather than
off the ids the dispatch declared:

| population | journal | proven to have run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a settled fan-out item | opened, started, settled | yes |
| an executing fan-out item | opened, started, still open | yes, the child reached the provider |
| a refused fan-out item | opened, queued, never started | no — and that is the point |
| an executing lone delegation | opened, started, still open | yes |

The ceiling is two. The delegation goes out first and holds one slot to the
death, which is what keeps capacity from returning under the fan-out; the
fan-out's first item takes the other, settles, and frees it for exactly one of
the two behind it. Which of those two wins is the scheduler's to decide, so the
arm never names them — an arm that did would be reporting a race as a premise.

The finding is a conjunction, and all three parts are separate columns:

```text
the journal proves the slot was granted
+ the child proves it reached the provider
+ the store has no record of that execution
```

Any two of them are not it. A slot grant without an arrival is an execution
nobody has shown happened; an absent record for work that never ran is the
correct answer, not a gap.

The two `holds` rows are the arm's own falsifier. `a settled fan-out item` and
`an executing lone delegation` run the same acknowledgement check as the row
under measurement — the same store, the same read, the same join by execution id
— so a green there is what says the check can see a record when one exists. If
all three went red together, the finding would be about persistence in general
and not about executions in flight.

`a refused fan-out item` bounds any fix the arm could support. An execution the
scheduler never admitted produced nothing, so the store is owed no record for
it, and a change that recorded every opening would satisfy the row above by
reintroducing exactly the proxy the delegation arms removed: a run object
existing read as execution having happened.

`no ghost, and how the rebuild names the cut` pins what a fix must not move. A
store that learned to record executions in flight leaves stale records behind
for the next process to fold, and reconstruction must still answer with no node
in `running` and an `interrupted-during-execution` for the item that held a slot.

### The reading

```text
Metric:      StoreAcknowledgesActiveExecution
Anchor:      SubagentStore metadata joined to the execution journal by the id
             the child recorded as its parent call, read twice: in the dying
             process and in the resumed one
Population:  executions this arm's own death placed in each of the four
             populations above — one each, or the arm is reported invalid
Excludes:    every execution outside this turn's delegation and fan-out; any
             population whose child is not proven to have reached the provider
Reads as:    whether the store can be asked about that execution, not whether
             the host knows it happened — the journal already answers that, and
             the two disagree
```

Measured on the current tree: the settled item is `completed` in both processes,
and the executing fan-out item and the lone delegation both read `running` then
`interrupted` — one store, one contract, whichever entry point opened the work.
`list_subagents` shows all three. The refused item is absent from the store, as
it should be, and the rebuild names both cuts without a ghost.

## The skill classification arms

These ask what kind of execution a `runAs: subagent` skill is. The question is
not rhetorical: the answer decides whether it belongs to the delegation class the
task and fan-out arms established, or is an execution class of its own — and
those lead to opposite work. Nothing here is a fix. A classification that guessed
would be answered by whichever plumbing happened to exist.

Two runners are measured apart rather than averaged, because they are different
surfaces and not two settings of one. `run_skill` prepares a transcript, supports
continuation, and saves a terminal; `read_only_skill` builds a session in memory,
refuses continuation, and stores nothing. Asking the second for durability would
be demanding it break its own contract, so the arms ask what it *is* instead.

Each arm answers seven dimensions, one row each, because a skill can share one
domain and not another — which is the whole reason this is a classification:

| Dimension | What it asks |
| --- | --- |
| scheduler | does it ask for admission the way every other delegation does? |
| graph | is anything drawn while it runs? |
| journal | is the execution recorded before it acts? |
| store | is there a record, and does it say the right thing? |
| cancel | does a stop reach it, and is the terminal the one that happened? |
| restart | can the next process explain it? |
| identity | does the record join the call that made it? |

The scheduler dimension has no refusal hook to read — a skill's acquire carries
none — so it is established as an A/B rather than from a record: the queued arm
proves the call went out, has not answered, the ceiling is occupied and no child
of its own reached the provider, while the running arm is the same dispatch with
capacity free and its child inside the provider. Only the slots check is reached
this way. A skill writer's whole-workspace claim is visible in the code and is
**not** measured here; separating writers from slots needs the shape
`wait-writers` uses, and this arm does not build it.

The identity row reads the two entry points apart on purpose. A model-invoked
skill has a tool call to join to; the controller's own entry point drops that id
deliberately, so an empty one there is top-level provenance rather than a lost
join. Both run in the same death in `skill-completed`, so the comparison is
between two lineages rather than between a value and an expectation.

The cancel row judges the terminal against an observed cause, never against
wording: the child's own context closed, which is what a cancellation does to it
and what a failure does not, so a record filing that as failed is naming the
wrong ending.

`skill-queued` is the negative control for everything below it, and it bounds any
convergence these arms could support. An execution the scheduler never admitted
produced nothing, so no layer owes it a record — a change that satisfied the
running arm by preparing a transcript at dispatch would break this one, which is
the proxy the delegation arms removed.

### The judgement

```text
the scheduler admitted it
+ its child reached the provider
+ no live graph, no journal entry and no store record names it
→ LOST-SILENT
```

For the read-only entry point that conjunction is not a defect: durable absence
is its contract, and the row says so. What remains worth naming there is
different — it holds a scheduler slot that nothing draws — so its verdicts are
`ephemeral-seen` and `ephemeral-unseen`, a classification rather than a pass.

The queued arm's negative control is about the store alone. An opening is the
orchestration saying work entered it, which a refused item did; a child record is
an execution artifact, which it has none of. Demanding silence from the journal
too would forbid the very record that tells a restart the item was held back
rather than lost.

The identity row checks a **join**, not one spelling. A record's parent is the
execution's own identity — the id the journal opened it under, which itself hangs
below the call the model made — so comparing it to the bare call id would fail
the chain that makes the two joinable.

The graph row carries the whole graph's node count beside its own answer,
because "the filter found nothing" and "there was nothing to find" are different
readings and only the second is what the row means.

`record-only` is the restart verdict for a child the store kept whose execution
no reconstruction names. That a store remembers a child finished is not that a
restart can place the delegated execution: the first is a record, the second is
provenance, and folding them would report a run nothing can situate as recovered.

## The ephemeral authority arms

The execution graph is a projection of durable facts. A reader starts from
`Controller.ExecutionGraph` and returns to it whenever the stream drops, and the
delta stream is a low-latency view of the same facts rather than a history to
replay into a state. That makes a node's provenance checkable: whatever the
snapshot cannot produce, a reader keeps only until its next resync.

These two arms hold both ephemeral entry points to that. Each dispatches a
research child that hangs, and reads three surfaces **at one instant** while it
is inside the provider — what the stream drew, what the authority held, and what
a reader is left with once a gap makes it start from the authority again. The
last is not a separate mechanism: a resync replaces the folded state rather than
merging into it, so it is the snapshot and nothing else.

The judgement is a conjunction, and the third clause is what makes it a defect
rather than a display choice:

```text
the stream drew a node
+ the authority cannot account for it
+ the child it named is still executing
→ a node that leaves the screen at the next resync
  while the work it names goes on holding a slot
```

Two rows read `absent` on a healthy run, which is the point: absence of a node
is what an entry point promising no durable side effects is entitled to. The
durable row is read rather than assumed, because a convergence that made an
ephemeral run visible by recording it would satisfy every row above and break
that promise instead.

### What it settled

`read_only_task` drew a group and a worker the authority could not produce; a
resync erased both while the child held its slot. `read_only_skill` drew nothing.
The two ephemeral entry points now agree: neither opens a delegation, so neither
claims anything a snapshot cannot justify, and both stay out of the journal and
the store as they always did.

That fixes an inconsistency rather than choosing a look. Which work is *drawn*
follows from which work the authority can account for, and an ephemeral run
cannot be — across a gap, a bootstrap, or a restart. Who is currently occupying
a scheduler slot is a real question and a different one; answering it belongs to
a live-only read model that can say plainly that it does not survive the
process, not to a graph that promises it does.

## The host-initiated arms

Their subject is one surface and the names say so: a person typing `/<skill>`
into a live session, routed through `Submit` to the controller's slash path. The
headless counterpart (`RunSubagentProfile`) is deliberately not measured with
them — it is a synchronous caller-owned call whose cancellation and session
ownership need not match, and reading one for the other is how a real number
gets the wrong subject. Its parity is a separate question.

Each arm prints **four identities apart**, because this is the first surface
where they may not coincide:

| identity | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| dispatch id (`slash-skill-N`) | a synthetic event id, minted so the child's activity can nest on screen |
| child ref (`sa_…`) | the store's artifact, which exists only once a transcript has been prepared |
| `ParentToolCallID` | the provider-visible call this descends from — correctly empty here |
| execution id | what a journal would have opened it under |

For a model-delegated run the last two are one string. That has only ever been
true because a tool call produced every durable execution there was, and this is
where the coincidence ends.

Three oracles hold across every arm:

- **A** — no persisted lineage may name a synthetic host id. It is UI identity;
  writing one down would say the model issued a call it never made.
- **B** — a host-started run's `ParentToolCallID` stays empty. It has no
  provider-visible parent, and filling it to make a join easier would trade a
  truth for a convenience.
- **C** — if a durable execution identity turns out to be needed, none of the
  three candidates above can be it. The arms test that by exhaustion rather than
  by assertion.

### What they found, and what changed

The first reading was narrower and sharper than "a slash skill records nothing".
The store was never empty: a slash-started child reaches the shared runner, so it
was already marked running before it acted and carried a correct terminal
afterwards. What was missing was the execution. Nothing had been opened, so
nothing placed that child — `record-only`, a reader could see a child of this
name was cut and could not say which invocation it belonged to. Only the queued
arm was silent outright: work the scheduler had admitted into its domain and then
refused leaves no child artifact, and there was nothing else to hold an identity.

That is what made the queued arm decide a linearization rather than a display.
The three candidate identities failed by exhaustion — the synthetic id may never
be persisted, the child ref does not exist while the work is queued, the parent
call must stay empty — so a host-started execution needed one of its own, minted
before the work is opened.

| arm | scheduler | provider | Graph | journal | store | lineage | pre-start id | restart |
| --- | --- | --- | :--: | :--: | --- | :--: | :--: | --- |
| completed | admitted | completed | root | ✓ | `completed` | empty | `host-…` | exact |
| queued-crash | **refused** | never entered | root, queued | ✓ | none | n/a | `host-…` | exact |
| running-crash | admitted | entered | root, running | ✓ | `running`→`interrupted` | empty | `host-…` | exact |
| cancel | admitted | cancelled | root, cancelled | ✓ | `cancelled` | empty | `host-…` | exact |

Synthetic host id persisted as lineage: **no**, before and after. The queued arm
is the one to read twice: the execution exists and is recorded while no child
artifact does, which is the whole reason the identity could not have been the
store's ref.

### Two host surfaces, one provenance

A person's `/<skill>` and the controller's own synchronous entry point are
different surfaces, and they are measured apart and then compared — never read
for one another. Every provenance row matches: the same host-owned execution
shape, the same empty lineage, the same journal, the same store join, the same
restart. Three things differ, and each follows from what the surface *is*:

| | interactive slash | headless call |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cancellation owner | the turn's gate | the caller's context |
| delta stream | draws the node | no sink to draw on |
| synthetic dispatch id | `slash-skill-N` | none minted |

So the contract is narrower than "the two are identical" and stronger than "both
work":

> **Host execution provenance is surface-independent. The live delta stream, the
> synthetic dispatch id, and cancellation ownership are surface-specific.**

The delta stream belongs on that list rather than in the parity failure column
because the authority — the snapshot, rebuilt from durable facts — holds the node
on both surfaces. The stream is where a sink exists; the account of what happened
is not.

## The one arm that reads the frontend

Every other arm compares values across the boundary. `ui-graph-mixed` compares
**doors**: a view assembled by replaying history as live transitions settles on
the same graph and tells the user that work which ended in a dead process is
starting now. Only a sequence can tell those apart, so the arm records one.

The resumed process serves the session on a loopback listener and runs the real
client against it — the production `SsePort`, the production `ExecutionStore`,
bundled from the frontend's own sources with its own toolchain. The probe plays
only the part the desktop shell plays: it forwards the kernel's frames onto a
bus that has no reconnect, which is the transport the bootstrap was written for.
Every visible state the store passes through is recorded, along with what each
delta it folded named.

Seven rows follow, and each one is a rule rather than a comparison:

| Rule | Why it is not the row above it |
| --- | --- |
| the first graph a resumed view draws | a picture that appears from a delta was assembled out of transitions |
| how work from the dead process entered the view | an execution the dead process opened may only arrive as part of an answer |
| a dead run shown as work in progress | one render tick is enough: the user saw it |
| interruptions the view names | what the host derived and what the view said, compared as sets |
| work started after the resume | a view that stopped folding deltas would satisfy every rule above |
| a node introduced twice in one session | idempotent underneath is not the same as introduced once |
| deltas naming work the dead process opened | the only rule that catches a republication at a view that already holds the snapshot |

The last two rules are the ones a value comparison cannot reach at all. A
republished history moves no visible state — the fold is idempotent — and is
still the kernel saying that finished work is happening now.

### The sabotages

A probe nobody has watched fail is a decoration, so the two ways this has been
got wrong are runnable:

```bash
go run ./benchmarks/runtime-resume -only ui-graph-mixed                      # holds=7
go run ./benchmarks/runtime-resume -only ui-graph-mixed -sabotage publish     # the republication rule fails
go run ./benchmarks/runtime-resume -only ui-graph-mixed -sabotage trajectory  # that one and the ghost rule fail
```

`publish` is a resume that helpfully republishes what it rebuilt, fired after
the client has read the snapshot — the only window where it can be seen at all,
because what a resume publishes *before* that is numbered below the watermark
the client then resumes past, and the bootstrap absorbs it. `trajectory` is the
frontend half: the line that used to build the graph out of the recorded
trajectory. It puts pre-death nodes back on screen as pending and running, which
is the ghost this whole line of work exists to prevent.

The arm needs `node` and the frontend's installed toolchain. Without either it
reports not-measured and says which, rather than passing quietly.

## The marker oracle

Every turn is tagged twice: `PROBE-MARK-nnn` in the user prompt and
`PROBE-ECHO-nnn` in the reply. A fold takes assistant work first while the
retention budget keeps user turns verbatim, so a one-sided tag lets a surviving
user turn hide the reply dropped beside it — the first version of this arm
reported "1-11 intact" for a fold that had removed four replies.

The judgement runs on the assistant side, and the shape a fold can produce is
narrow: an optional pinned head, then one run of replies reaching the newest
turn. Two gaps, or a run that stops short of the newest turn, is a loss no fold
made. The scripted digest contains no tag, so a summary can never stand in for
a message that should have survived verbatim.

`refold_test.go` holds the oracle to that: a test that cannot fail proves
nothing, so the shapes only a loss can produce are asserted to be caught.

## The open-decision gate

This one does not ask whether a particular card comes back. "The same question
must survive" is a design requirement nobody has established: the goroutine
parked on it did not survive, so a restored card with nothing behind it would
be a durable-looking state that cannot be answered. The arm classifies instead:
**resumable** (the question is there to answer), **interrupted-explicit** (it is
gone and the host records that a turn was cut), or **LOST-SILENT** (gone, with
nothing saying it existed). Only the last is a defect.

One row is not a classification. The scripted round asks *and* tries to write in
the same reply; calling ask ends the round, so the write is the effect the
decision is holding back. It must not run while the answer is pending and must
not run because a later process loaded the session. Whether the question
survives is a design choice; whether what it blocked stayed blocked is not.

The process exits rather than shutting down: a clean close resolves or cancels
the question, which is the one thing a process dying mid-decision does not do.

## The successor arms

Three arms share `open-decision`'s ending and differ only in what the next
process does. They need a middle phase that runs a model — nothing else can
represent a person carrying on — so the discipline shifts rather than bends:
the phase that judges what the host knows is still the model-free one after it.

The `interrupted-answered` arm is the end-to-end reading worth naming. A turn
that reads like an answer to the dead question gets the interruption as
context, and the write that question was holding back still does not run.
Context continuity and execution continuation are different things, and this is
where the difference is measured rather than argued.

## The todo identity gate

`todoIdentityProjection` calls itself a turn-tail note owed when the host holds
step ids the conversation no longer shows. Once the frozen body stopped holding
the live tail, that claim became checkable, and the arm checks all three parts
of it rather than whether a note exists: exactly one note reaches the model, it
rides the tail, and it names the ids the host holds now.

The scenario moves identity while a fold sits between the model and it — write
a list, fold, grow, rewrite the list, grow again, fold again — because one run
then separates placement from duplication from staleness. The rewrite keeps the
in_progress item and replaces the pending work: the host refuses to drop an
item in flight, so that is what a list rewrite actually looks like.

The second growth is not padding. A fold that leaves the new ids readable asks
the note for nothing, and the arm would pass without ever exercising it — so
the gate reports whether the ids were still readable, and expects no note when
they were. Otherwise the migration could turn into an unconditional append and
every row would still be green.

## Verdicts

Not booleans. "The host holds it verbatim" and "a fold over canonical artifacts
happens to agree" are different durability claims, and a row that was never
established supports neither.

| Verdict | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `persisted-direct` | a named artifact holds the value; the resumed value equals it |
| `reconstructed-exact` | no verbatim artifact; re-derived from canonical state and equal |
| `reconstructed-lossy` | present after the boundary but different |
| `lost` | established before, absent after |
| `not-measured` | never established before — the row asks nothing |
| `changed` / `stable` | the arm's own control row, not a durability claim |
| `contiguous` / `HOLE` | the shape of surviving work in the view, for a fold |
| `holds` / `VIOLATED` | a contract the arm asserts outright, not a comparison |

`not-measured` exists so the probe cannot commit the substitution the
benchmarks contract names: **not evaluated read as false**. A row the construct
phase failed to establish is not a defect, and the first run of this probe hit
exactly that — a rejected `todo_write` reported `not-measured`, not `lost`.

## Metric contract

```text
Metric:      ProjectionSurvivesProcessBoundary
Anchor:      Controller.ContextMaintenanceSnapshot().CheckpointState, read in
             process B after Resume and before any provider call
Population:  arms whose construct phase reached CheckpointState != "none" and
             whose control row matches what the arm set up
Excludes:    arms marked ARM INVALID; rows whose construct value is empty;
             any reading taken after a turn has run in phase B
Reads as:    whether the next request would ride the folded projection, not
             whether a projection is stored — the sidecar row answers that
             separately, and the two disagree
```

The two projection rows are deliberately separate. A sidecar that loads and a
projection the next request actually rides are different states, and conflating
them is how a stored-but-unused projection reads as healthy.

## What this does not measure

- **Whether a restored question could be answered.** The `open-decision` arm
  can see that a question is gone; it cannot tell a restored one that works
  from a restored one whose owner died with the process. Answering that needs a
  phase that tries to answer, which this probe deliberately does not have.
- **The run graph.** `publishGraph` emits `GraphDelta` to the event sink; the
  probe never runs a fan-out, so the graph rows report `not-measured`. The
  narrow question to answer next is not "should the graph be persisted" but
  "can process B rebuild process A's terminal graph from artifacts that already
  exist" — the session event log is a transcript log, not this event stream.
- **Anything that only happens at turn time**, because phase B deliberately
  does not take a turn. A resumed session's leading system row is the persisted
  one; whether a later turn swaps in the freshly composed prompt is outside
  this probe's boundary.
- One session shape, one workspace, one platform per run.

## Provenance

Studio independently converged on the durable covered-identity contract also
present in main-v2 `f60ab17b0` (#8923); that commit is not in studio's
ancestry. The same commit carries two further contracts studio has not adopted
— live-tail ownership, and wire-safe fingerprint compatibility — which is why
that line is ported by contract rather than by file.

## The fan-out arms

Three arms ask the graph the question the decision arm asked the approval gate:
after the live owner dies, what does durable truth still hold? They classify
rather than pass or fail, and the labels are not a scale — **reconstructed-exact**,
**interrupted-explicit** and **reconstructed-lossy** are designs a host may
legitimately hold, while **LOST-SILENT** (gone, with nothing recording that it
existed) and **GHOST-RUNNING** (still drawn as running with no owner alive) are
defects. Ghost outranks every reconstruction: a fan-out that came back complete
and still says running is the worst of the five, not the best, for the same
reason a restored decision card with nothing behind it is worse than a dropped
one.

Two populations are classified separately, because one label over both reports
the better half. The items that had already settled own durable child records;
the item still executing has never been written down anywhere.

All three arms die inside the turn. The completed arm is not the exception: it
waits until every worker is terminal and then exits the same way, so what
separates the arms is which states the graph holds at the moment of death and
nothing else. Letting one arm shut down cleanly would have made it the only arm
whose turn was appended, and the comparison would have been reading that
instead.

`skipped` is missing from the mixed arm on purpose. A fan-out publishes an
item's skip only in its closing outcome delta, so no node reads skipped until
the group has ended — by which time nothing is running, and "skipped beside
running" is not a state a live fan-out can hold. The item whose dependency
already failed sits at `pending` instead, which is what the arm dies holding.

These arms run under the `auto` approval gate rather than the denied one every
other arm uses. `fleet` is not read-only, so a denied gate refuses the dispatch
before any child starts and the arm would measure a permission decision instead
of a process boundary.

## The invariant execution persistence must hold

> **Persisting execution existence must never imply resumability.**

A durable record saying that child B existed, held grant G, and was live when
its owner disappeared says exactly that. It does not say restart B, re-run its
tool calls, or continue its goroutine. This is the same shape as the decision
arm's finding — context continuity is not execution continuation — reached
independently: the moment execution facts become durable, the cheap next step
is to replay them, and that turns today's `LOST-SILENT` into the one outcome
this matrix ranks as worse than losing the graph.

The ghost row is where that invariant is enforced. It was green before anything
was stored, which is safety by absence rather than by design; it has to stay
green now that a journal exists, and any persistence that makes it red has
replayed something it should only have recorded.

## What the execution journal moved, and what it did not

The in-flight item was `LOST-SILENT` because a turn is appended when it ends:
nothing on disk had heard of the fan-out. `<stem>.execution.jsonl` is written
before the dispatch becomes observable, so that item now reads
`interrupted-explicit`. Two rows report it — what the journal recorded, and what
the next request is told about it — and the second one is a contract, not a
description: one block while an interruption stands, none otherwise.

Deliberately unmoved: settled items stay `reconstructed-lossy`. Their answers
already live in the sub-agent store, and a second durable copy of "this child
completed" would be a second authority to reconcile the moment the two files
disagree. The journal records that a delegation entered the orchestration and
that the orchestration let go of it, never how it ended.

**An execution record proves that work entered orchestration; it does not prove
that the work is resumable.** Whether it *started* is a separate durable fact,
recorded at the slot grant — before anything can observe the item running and
before the child can act. A restart therefore inherits two kinds of
interruption rather than one:

| Journal | Restart reads |
| --- | --- |
| opened, never started, not settled, no owner | `interrupted-before-start` — it never reached a slot, so nothing it would have done was done |
| opened, started, not settled, no owner | `interrupted-during-execution` — whatever it had written stands, whatever it had not is undone |

Neither is resumable, and neither is ever written down: both are derived from
an open entry with no live owner, because the process that died had no chance
to record either. The mixed arm is the acceptance test — it dies holding an
item its dependency blocked and an item that was executing, and the two must
come back classified differently.

The ordering a fan-out declared rides the opening, so an item that never
started can name what it was held behind: the mixed arm's restart reads
`fleet-3 <- fleet-2`, unchanged across the boundary. A dependency is not
scheduler state and is deliberately not recorded as one — an unmet dependency
is why an item is not yet ready, a slot is what a ready item waits for, and
`agentgraph` keeps `pending` and `queued` apart for that reason.

A declared dependency explains what an item was ordered behind, not whether that
dependency was ever met. What separates an item its upstream never released from
one that became ready and then waited for a slot is the queue record: the first
has none, the second names the ceiling that refused it.

## The scheduler-wait arms

Four arms ask a narrower question than the fan-out ones. Classification is
already right — `STARTED` settled that — so these ask whether the host can still
say **why** a ready item never started.

They are separate arms because `canStartLocked` decides in a fixed order:
slots, then writers, then claim. An arm that let an earlier check fire would
report that refusal as the later one, so each clears every check above the one
it measures — the slots arm refuses a reader, which is not a writer at all; the
writers arm leaves total capacity free and gives its two writers disjoint
paths; the claim arm leaves both ceilings free. The ceilings come from a project
`tempora.toml`, which is where a person sets them, rather than from a poked
field.

`wait-claim` needs two fan-outs. A single fleet's preflight refuses concurrent
writers whose claims overlap, so the holder is dispatched as a background fleet
and the refused writer comes from a later one. Both it and `wait-transition`
wait on a signal the holder's own child sends once its slot is granted:
dispatching earlier lets the refused item win the race and start.

`wait-transition` answers what the cause means. It frees the ceiling the
refusal named while the item stays queued, held back by a different one, and
the graph still reports the first: one report, not two. So `WaitCause` is the
cause that **queued** the request, not the one holding it now — which is why
the durable record is named for entering the queue rather than for waiting.

Measured, all four: the refusal is reached in isolation, reported exactly once,
and read back after the restart with its cause intact. The three values are
kept apart rather than folded into "a ceiling refused it": the scheduler knew
which one, and a journal that discards a distinction the host actually drew
cannot get it back. A reader that only wants capacity-versus-claim can fold
them; the record does not fold them first.

A queue record proves more than the refusal. An item reaches the scheduler only
once its dependencies are answered, so a queued entry is durable evidence that
the dependency gate was crossed — which a declared ordering alone can never
say. That is the difference between the mixed arm's `fleet-3`, whose journal
reads `open` and nothing else, and a refused item, whose journal reads
`open queued(slots)`.

## The terminal-disposition arms

`SETTLED` says an opening is no longer active and nothing else. These four ask
what that costs, by putting lifecycles that look identical beside meanings that
are opposite.

What the journal actually holds, measured:

| Disposition | Durable lifecycle | Told apart by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| adopted | `open+adopted` | the opening's own disposition |
| skipped (dependency cut) | `open+settled` | nothing else reaches this shape today |
| cancelled (never admitted) | `open+queued(cause)+settled` | the queue record |
| cancelled (was running) | `open+started+settled` | — |
| failed | `open+started+settled` | — |
| completed | `open+started+settled` | — |

Adopted survives because the disposition rides the opening: an adoption is
declared before anything runs, so it is durable for the same reason the
ordering is. Its **source** now rides it too — the reference whose answer stood
in is taken from the same delta that draws the adopt edge, so the graph and the
journal cannot name different sources, and a restart can say both that an item
was adopted and what paid for it.

An opening is held to one story about itself: an adoption must name a source,
and an item that is going to run must not carry one. Older entries recorded
before the source was captured stay readable as adoptions whose source is
unknown — lossy history, not corruption, and nothing else in the record could
be read to guess it.

The bottom three rows are the real collapse. `open+started+settled` covers
completed, failed and cancelled alike; the sub-agent store settles the first
two, and what it says about a cancelled child is a separate question this batch
did not ask. Skipped is distinguishable today only because nothing else
produces `open+settled` — a distinction by absence, not by record.

**A population that does not exist.** These arms were built expecting two ways
to reach skipped: a dependency cut in `fleet`, and a cancellation before start
in `parallel_tasks`. The second is unreachable. `parallel_tasks` sets
`running[idx]` when it dispatches an item, not when the scheduler admits one,
and every item is dispatched in one pass — so a cancellation finds `running[i]`
true for all of them and marks them cancelled. The arm was renamed to what it
actually reaches rather than constructed into the shape it was supposed to have.

**Context is derivable, but not after a restart.** Two samples — an upstream
that answered and one that failed — both show the delivery edges exactly
matching what "an ordering edge whose upstream answered" predicts. So a context
edge needs no record of its own. It does need the upstream's disposition, and
that is precisely what is not durable: after the boundary the prediction goes
empty, because the answered set comes from the graph rather than the journal.
Context does not belong in the vocabulary; it belongs behind whatever makes a
disposition durable.

### The terminal no owner keeps

`child-terminal` reaches all three executed terminals in one group and compares
the two owners of the same fact:

When this arm was written, no owner kept it:

```
graph:   cancelled=2 completed=1 failed=1
store:   completed=1 failed=3          ← every error path saved a child as failed
journal: all four items open+started+settled
```

The graph drew cancellation apart from failure; the store, which owns what
happened to a child, folded it in. The journal could not help — it records
orchestration, not outcome — so the distinction was not merely un-persisted,
it was unkept. That made it a store defect rather than a journal gap: adding a
cancelled record to the journal would have created a second authority for a
fact the store already owns, with nothing to settle the first disagreement.

The store now keeps it, and the arm reads:

```
graph:   cancelled=2 completed=1 failed=1
store:   cancelled=2 completed=1 failed=1
journal: all four items open+started+settled   ← unchanged, and it must stay so
```

The journal row is part of the gate. A fix that made this arm green by teaching
the journal about cancellation would have passed the comparison while breaking
the boundary the comparison exists to protect.

One thing these arms had to work around: `Controller.Cancel()` does nothing to
a synchronous headless `Run`. That path does not pass through turn admission,
so the gate Cancel operates has nothing registered for it, and the arm cancels
the turn's context instead — which is how a headless caller interrupts anyway.

## The derivability arms

Everything before these asked what survives. These ask what still has to be
written down — a fact a restart can compute from what is already durable needs
no record of its own, and adding one would give it a second owner for nothing.

They stand on one join: a child's metadata names the execution it ran for, so a
restart can ask the store what each item ended as. `Answered` is then
computable without the graph: an adoption says so on its own opening, and
everything else is the store's terminal.

**Skipped state derives.** An item the orchestration released without ever
starting it, ordered behind something that did not answer, is exactly the set
the picture drew — in both skip arms, and empty in the arm where both upstreams
answered.

**Context derives, including through an adoption.** The dependent receives from
both upstreams, one that completed and one that was adopted, and the prediction
matches edge for edge. The adopted half only works because the source rides the
opening: without it that upstream would read as unanswered and the edge would
go missing.

**The cause derives too, but not the way it looks.** The two skip arms leave
identical durable facts — both upstreams failed, either could have been named —
and the picture names a different one in each:

| | picture named | by declaration order | by earliest release |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `derive-skip-both` | `a` | `a` ✓ | `a` ✓ |
| `derive-skip-flip` | `b` | `a` ✗ | `b` ✓ |

Declaration order is refuted. Earliest release holds, and not by luck: a
fan-out cuts a branch when it processes the first result that did not complete,
and an item is released from the journal in that same handler. The order the
journal records is the order the choice was made in. The cause is a historical
fact — and it is already written down, in the timestamps.

The two arms did not always differ by construction. `PROBE-CHILD-FAIL` is a
prefix of the sentinel meant to delay the second failure, and sentinels are
matched by substring, so for a while both children failed at once and the order
was whatever the runtime chose. The rule survived that — it reads the order
that actually happened — but the arms now hold the second failure until the
first has been recorded, and repeat.

So none of the three needs a record. Skipped stays a derived state, context a
derived edge, and the cause a derived reading of when each upstream was

## Rebuilding the graph

`internal/state/execgraph` folds the journal, the store's child terminals, and this
process's live executions into a graph. It recomputes rather than restores:
nothing reads a file or emits an event, and the same inputs always give the
same picture.

The three fan-out arms compare it against what the dying process drew:

| | states | topology | grants + waits | not-live | identity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `graph-completed` | exact | exact | exact | — | exact |
| `graph-running` | exact | exact | exact | exact | exact |
| `graph-mixed` | exact | exact | exact | exact | exact |

Two states are deliberately never rebuilt. An execution that was running or
waiting when its owner disappeared does not come back as running or queued —
the owner is gone, and either state would describe work nobody is doing. Those
are named as interruptions instead, split by whether they had reached a slot,
and the arms check that set rather than letting the state row quietly drop them.

The one remaining gap is the worker identity, and `identity-semantics` is the
arm that says exactly what it is. It names a worker four ways across both
producers and reads all three layers:

| item | graph | store |
| --- | --- | --- |
| names nothing | `none/none` | `probe/scripted/none` |
| names a model and effort | `probe/alt/high` | `probe/alt/high` |
| names only an effort | `none/low` | `probe/scripted/low` |
| adopts, runs nothing | `none/none` | no child at all |

`fleet` and `parallel_tasks` agree cell for cell — there is no producer
disagreement to fix. What the two columns differ about is which layer they
report. The graph shows what the sub-agent layer resolved, where empty means
*inherit the parent*; the store shows the final identity, with the empty slots
already filled in.

Which settled the question the arm was built to ask. The graph's layer is the
one worth keeping — an empty model says the worker layer named nothing and the
parent's value stands, and rewriting it as the resolved identity would delete
that. So the opening records it, and the rebuild reads it from there and never
from the store.

The distinction only exists if absence is preserved. An entry that recorded the
worker layer and named nothing, and an entry written before the record existed,
both read back empty; only presence tells them apart, and a reader that lost it
would report a legacy entry as an exact reconstruction of an inheritance it had
never seen. The spec is therefore stored whole, present even when both fields
are empty, and an older entry that has none leaves the identity unknown rather
than borrowing the store's.

The skip-cause rows read three ways: the upstream the picture named, the rules
this benchmark works out on its own, and what the production fold concludes.
That is deliberate — a probe that only asked the implementation would agree
with it by construction.
