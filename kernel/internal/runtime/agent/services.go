// agentServices are the collaborators an Agent talks to, separated from the
// state it remembers. This is not a lifetime: the controller rebinds most of
// these between turns through the Set* seams, and fork wraps prov mid-run. A
// nil field is a capability the host did not wire, which each reader handles.

	// opaque provider-configuration fingerprint (#7059). The legacy type and file
	// names preserve the on-disk v2 contract. nil keeps in-memory gating only.

	// gate is the per-call permission gate for both standard and Plan
	// workflows. nil disables gating entirely.

	// extensions is the frozen Extension Protocol v2 dispatcher for this
	// controller generation; nil means every intercept point passes through
	// byte-identically. See extensions.go.

	// captures preimages before tools run and fingerprints after, regardless of
	// outcome. Never changes provider-visible schemas or prompts.

	// jobs is the session's background-job manager, stamped onto each tool
	// call's context so the background tools can reach it. nil degrades

	// subagent write claims. Set on the parent executor only.

	// session, acquired lazily on the first mutation and held through the final
	// participating run so verification stays isolated.
