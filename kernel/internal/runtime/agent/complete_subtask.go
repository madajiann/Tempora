Call complete_subtask when you believe this sub-task is done. State the acceptance
criteria you were held to and attach, for each, the command you ran or the paths you
changed or inspected. The host checks every citation against what it observed you
actually do, and answers with a verdict: needs_work means a claim is not backed by
anything it saw — do that work and submit again; closed means the sub-task is done and
nothing further is asked of you. Cite real work only and put anything you assumed
rather than verified in unresolved.
