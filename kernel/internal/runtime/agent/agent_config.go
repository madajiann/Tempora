// it afterwards, which agent_config_test.go enforces. Embedded rather than
// nested so access stays flat, as perTurnState already does. Separating it lets
// the struct-state ratchet count reachable states instead of size: an immutable
// field combines with nothing. Anything that changes after New goes on Agent.
