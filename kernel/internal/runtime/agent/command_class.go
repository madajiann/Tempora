// The static tables will never know every tool, and each one that falls through
// reads as "might write", blocking work that only reads. This is the escalation

// every write regardless of the answer.
const commandClassSystemPrompt = `You classify one shell command as read-only or not.

READONLY: running it cannot create, modify, or delete any file, and cannot change
process or system state. Reading files and printing to stdout are read-only, no
matter how much it reads or prints.

WRITES: it can write, delete, or change permissions on a file; install something;
start or kill a process; or run code handed to it as an argument.

Judge the command in front of you, not the program in general. Most inspection
programs read by default and only write when a flag or construct says so:
-i/--in-place, -o/--output, -w, --fix, --write, a > redirection, or code passed
inline (-c, -e, sed's s///e, awk's print > "file", find -exec).

Answer with exactly one word: READONLY or WRITES.
If you cannot tell what it would do, answer WRITES.`
