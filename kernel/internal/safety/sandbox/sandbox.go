// Package sandbox wraps a shell command in an OS-level jail so the model's
// `bash` calls are confined: it may read almost freely but write only inside
// the writable roots (workspace, configured extras, plus temp and toolchain
// caches), with optional forbid-read roots, and reach the network only when
// allowed. This is the *enforcement* layer beneath the permission rules
// (*policy*): a permitted command still cannot escape the box.
//
// macOS uses Seatbelt via sandbox-exec and Linux uses bubblewrap when available.
// Windows does not currently provide an OS-level bash sandbox and resolves the
// product setting to off. When enforce is requested but no OS sandbox backend
// is available, the bash tool fails closed instead of running the command
// unwrapped.
// Confining the in-process file-writer built-ins is handled separately, in
// package tool/builtin.
