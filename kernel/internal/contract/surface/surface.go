// Package surface names the frontend a turn ran behind. One vocabulary,
// because three consumers spell it and none of them owns it: the usage record
// on disk, the telemetry counter on the wire, and the label a hub stamps on
// every session it opens. Spelled in three places it drifts, and the drift is
// invisible — a turn attributed to the wrong frontend still adds up.
