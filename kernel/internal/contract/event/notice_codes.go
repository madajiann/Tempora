// notice_codes.go — the wire-stable vocabulary a frontend localizes notices by.
package event

// Notice codes are stable machine-readable identifiers for known notices.
// Frontends localize a notice's main copy by Code and fall back to matching
// the English Text (or showing it raw) when Code is empty or unknown, so
// wording edits in Go no longer silently break localization. Values are
// wire-stable: never rename or reuse one once shipped.
