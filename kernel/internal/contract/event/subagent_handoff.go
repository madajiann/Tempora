// built to insist on one — so it observes and never decides. Content-free:
// counts, enums and rounds, never a prompt, a path or a summary.

	ReadOnly bool
	// Expected is set where the host actually appended the contract, never
	// inferred from a registry: the denominator has to be the host's own

	Expected bool
	// Exit says how the run ended. A provider timeout that produced no report
	// is not a compliance failure and must leave the denominator.
	Exit string // completed | error | cancelled | no_answer

	// Malformed the ones it refused. Missing with attempts is a schema
	// problem; missing without them is a protocol one.
