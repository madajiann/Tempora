# Tool Contract

This document records the provider-visible contract for Tempora compile-time built-in tools. It is generated from the same canonical schema path used by the runtime registry.

| Tool | Read-only | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bash` | false | Execute a command in the shell and return combined stdout/stderr. Use for builds, tests, git, package managers, etc. To read or modify a file use read_file / edit_file / write_file — never Get-Content, cat, sed, head/tail or a shell redirect. read_file returns up to 2000 lines per call, each prefixed with its line number, and those numbers are what edit_file targets; paging a file through the shell instead costs one round trip per chunk and yields no line anchors. |
| `bash_output` | true | Read new output from a background job started with bash(run_in_background=true) or task(run_in_background=true). Returns the output produced since the last bash_output call for that job, plus its status (running/done/failed/killed). Does not block. |
| `browser_act` | false | Operate a page with real input. Ordered steps stop at the first failure; target by ref, or screenshot x/y. Returns results, page errors and changes. fill replaces, type inserts; press takes keys like Enter or Control+a; select sets a <select>; scroll takes delta_y or delta_x; drag ends at to_ref or to_x/to_y; upload gives a file input workspace files; dialog answers prompts; eval executes arbitrary page JavaScript from script and awaits promises; resize sets the viewport to width×height; back, forward and reload move this tab. |
| `browser_open` | false | Load a page in your browser and return its snapshot: one element per line, with [eN] refs for browser_act. url is http(s), about:blank or a workspace file. Without url, tab switches to that tab; close closes it. |
| `browser_read` | true | Read a browser page: snapshot (default; page with offset/limit, or ref for one subtree), find (lines carrying text, with their refs), screenshot (browser_act x/y use its pixels, and the person is shown it too), logs (errors since you last read them), network (what it requested and what came back; text narrows by URL), tabs. |
| `code_index` | true | Lightweight built-in code symbol index. Prefer lsp_* for language semantics and installed code graph MCP tools for call graph, impact, and architecture relationships; use this as the local fallback for file outlines and symbol definition candidates, then verify with read_file or grep. |
| `complete_step` | true | Record the evidence-backed completion of ONE step of an approved plan. Call it as you finish each step instead of silently moving on: a completion with no evidence is REJECTED, so don't claim a step is done until you can show why. The host advances the list for you — it marks this step completed and moves the next to in_progress, so a todo_write that marks such an item completed on its own is REJECTED too. Sign off one step per tool-call ROUND, not one per call: the sign-off promotes the next item, and a second sign-off sent beside it signs against the list as it stood before. |
| `compress` | true | Compress a selected part of the current model-visible conversation without deleting visible history. Use only when the user explicitly asks for context compression. Choose `before` to summarize everything before the uniquely matched user turn while keeping that turn and later context, or `after` to summarize from that turn through the last completed turn while keeping the active turn. The anchor must be an exact, unique excerpt from a real user message; use a longer excerpt if the tool reports multiple matches. |
| `computer_act` | false | Operate another application. Steps run in order and stop at the first failure. Through its accessibility actions, leaving the pointer alone: click (ref, or x/y from a screenshot), right_click opens a ref's context menu, focus and set_value take a ref, type enters text where focus is and paste puts it there at once (the clipboard is borrowed and put back), key presses keys like Enter or Meta+s (control+s on Windows; times repeats), hold_key holds one for seconds. Paste needs the application in front on macOS; on Windows type, paste and key bring it forward. scroll brings a ref into view or turns the wheel by amount lines, wait pauses ms. pointer_move, pointer_click (button, times), pointer_drag (to_x/to_y) and pointer_position instead take the person's pointer and bring the application forward, approved separately; use them for what has no accessibility action, and the pointer goes back where it was. Returns a snapshot afterwards. |
| `computer_read` | false | See another application on this computer, named as what=apps lists it. what=apps lists applications with windows; snapshot returns its accessibility tree with [aN] refs for computer_act; screenshot captures its front window (computer_act x/y use its pixels, and the person is shown it too). |
| `context_budget` | true | Report how much context room is left before this conversation is automatically compacted. Call it before committing to work whose output you may not be able to finish reading — a broad search, a large file, a long build log — so you can narrow the command instead of spending the rest of the window discovering it was too big. `tokens_remaining` counts down to the compaction trigger, not to the physical window, because the fold is what you can still act ahead of. |
| `delete_range` | false | Delete a contiguous text range from a file using exact start/end text anchors. Each anchor must match exactly one line. Returns unified diff on success. Use for large deletions — smaller changes should use edit_file. |
| `delete_symbol` | false | Delete a named symbol (function, method, type, interface, const, var) from a Go source file using AST parsing. For non-Go files, use delete_range with manual anchors. |
| `edit_file` | false | Replace an exact string in a file with another. old_string must occur exactly once; add surrounding context to disambiguate. Use for targeted edits instead of rewriting the whole file. |
| `glob` | true | Find files matching a glob pattern (e.g. "*.go", "internal/*/*.go", "**/*.test.ts"). Supports shell metacharacters * ? [] and the recursive ** pattern. |
| `grep` | true | Search for a regular expression in a file, or recursively under a directory (skips hidden files and files matched by .gitignore). Returns matching lines as path:line:text, capped at 200 matches. Ignored paths are searched only when nothing else matched; such matches say so, so an empty answer means absent rather than filtered. |
| `kill_shell` | false | Terminate a running background job (bash or task) started with run_in_background. A no-op if the job has already finished or the id is unknown. |
| `ls` | true | List the entries of a directory. Directories are shown with a trailing slash; files show their byte size. Set recursive=true to list all nested files depth-first (skips .git/node_modules). |
| `move_file` | false | Move or rename a file from source_path to destination_path. Creates the destination parent directory as needed. Use instead of shell mv, Move-Item, or ren for file moves so workspace confinement and file-edit permissions apply. |
| `multi_edit` | false | Apply a list of edits to a single file atomically: each edit runs against the result of the previous one, all in memory; the file is rewritten only if every edit succeeds. Cheaper and safer than chaining edit_file calls — a failure in step 3 leaves the file untouched instead of half-edited. |
| `notebook_edit` | false | Edit one cell of a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb). Target a cell by 0-based cell_number (or cell_id). edit_mode: "replace" (default) swaps the cell's source; "insert" adds a new cell after cell_number (use -1 to prepend at the top), taking cell_type and new_source; "delete" removes the cell. cell_type is "code" or "markdown" (required for insert). Editing a code cell clears its outputs. Prefer this over edit_file for notebooks — it keeps the JSON valid. |
| `read_file` | true | Read a text file with optional line offset/limit. Output prefixes each line with its 1-based number (e.g. `   42→...`) so subsequent edit_file calls can target exact lines. Use `offset` and `limit` to page through large files; the tool reports total length and pagination hints in a trailer. |
| `recall` | true | Bring folded conversation back: read the #n positions listed under "Folded work index" in a compaction summary, or search the whole folded region by query when no index line names what you need. Prefer re-reading a file over recalling it — a current copy beats a folded one. One budget per compaction covers both, and a request past it is refused whole, not truncated. |
| `todo_write` | true | Record and update a structured task list for the current work. Send the COMPLETE list every call — it replaces the previous one. Use it to plan multi-step work and show progress: keep exactly one item in_progress at a time, and flip an item to completed the moment it's done (don't batch completions). Skip it for trivial single-step tasks. The list is two-level: a `level` 0 item is a PHASE (a milestone) and the `level` 1 items after it are its concrete sub-steps. COPY `step_id` VERBATIM for every item that already has one: it is how a completion stays attached to its step when you retitle it, insert a step above it, or reorder the list. Give a new item a fresh unique id (e.g. "plan_step_07"); never reuse or renumber an existing one. |
| `update_goal` | true | Report this turn's disposition for the active goal. Call it at the end of every goal turn instead of using prose markers: `continue` (work is ongoing — give a concrete next_action), `complete` (the request is fully done, output format and constraints satisfied, and verification was attempted or reported unavailable), or `blocked` (only the user can unblock: missing user-only information, an irreversible/externally visible operation, or changed scope). The host validates your claim against Delivery acceptance criteria and decides whether to continue automatically. |
| `wait` | true | Block until background jobs finish, then return each job's status and final output/answer. Use to collect the result of a task(run_in_background) or bash(run_in_background) before continuing. Omit job_ids to wait for every running job. |
| `web_fetch` | true | Fetch a URL over HTTPS/HTTP and return its text content. HTML pages are reduced to readable text (scripts, styles, tags stripped, whitespace collapsed); JSON / plain text / markdown bodies come back verbatim. Use to read documentation pages, API responses, or source files hosted somewhere the local filesystem can't reach. |
| `write_file` | false | Write content to a file at the given path (overwriting existing content). Creates parent directories as needed. Sends the whole file every time: for a change to part of one that already exists, edit_file and multi_edit send only the changed region. |

## Schema Snapshot

The exact canonical schemas are intentionally tested in code rather than copied by hand here. Run:

```bash
go test ./internal/contract/tool -run TestBuiltinToolContractDocumentation
```

The test checks that every registered built-in tool has a documented name, read-only flag, description row, and canonical schema generated by `tool.BuiltinContractEntries`.

## Default Full Boot Surface

In a default full-token boot, Tempora sends the built-in tools above plus the
session, memory, skill, subagent, LSP, install, and slash-command tools below:

Single-model Balanced uses this exact executor tool surface. Balanced with a
distinct Planner and every Delivery session additionally expose one stable
proxy, `use_capability`, so optional MCP servers (including `auto_start=false`)
can be inspected and called without changing provider-visible schemas
mid-session. Delivery also
adds a stable execution contract enforced by the host: state-changing and
verification commands need acceptance criteria; changed work cannot finalize
without post-change review, verification, and an evidence-backed
`complete_step` sign-off; Skill/MCP `require`/`prefer` routes are gated with
host-proven evidence (including read-only answers — ordinary reads never skip
a required capability); and medium/high-risk mutations force structured
`review` / `security_review` results via the review-only `review_report` tool,
whose `reviewed_paths` must be backed by host-observed read/diff receipts.

The two-model Planner and all task/fleet sub-agents also use `use_capability`
(and never direct `mcp__*` schemas). Planner and ordinary writer-capable
sub-agents may call installed or project-configured MCP without
`readOnlyHint`; Planner leaves `destructiveHint` tools for the Executor, while
ordinary sub-agents use the trusted MCP path (live authorization plus explicit
deny only). Writer/destructive calls are still serialized and recorded as
mutations for evidence, workspace leases, and Delivery guards. Strict read-only sub-agents
share the same proxy schema and Host connections but still require
`readOnlyHint` and non-destructive at execution time. Balanced dual-model
attaches independent proxy frontends to both Planner and Executor so a
capability discovered during planning remains directly callable after handoff;
their ledgers/audits are isolated while Host connections are shared. Economy
remains single-model without an independent Planner.

`use_capability` resolution is side-effect free: `action=list` returns sorted
configured MCP servers without starting them; `action=call` on a
not-yet-connected server resolves to a deferred target, Plan re-checks only an
explicit phase opt-out on the real target, and the server process starts only
after the permission gate and PreToolUse hooks approve the call. On-demand children
share the session lifetime (they outlive the starting call and exit with the
session); `action=inspect` lists live tools for connected servers and cached
schemas otherwise, never starting a process. First discovery of a server with
no schema cache goes through `action=call` on the `mcp-server:` id itself: it
resolves to a gated connect (permission name = the server's dedicated
`mcp_connect__<server>` identity, so an exact rule such as
`deny = ["mcp_connect__github"]` blocks process startup) that connects after
approval and returns the live tool directory. MCP tool rules remain exact;
`mcp__github__*` is not a tool-name glob. Installing an MCP authorizes the
Planner to use its non-destructive tools; third-party servers that omit
`destructiveHint` are treated as user-install trust. Before every connect or
`tools/call`, the frontend re-checks the current runtime enablement,
authorization, and exact Host connection identity; another project/tab's
same-name shared client is rejected without process, network, or tool dispatch.

The fixed proxy's provider-visible name, description, schema, and ordering do
not change when MCP inventory changes. Balanced Executor deliberately retains
its direct `mcp__*` tools, so its overall provider prefix may still change when
those direct tools are installed, connected, or refreshed.

`ask`, `await_user`, `docs`, `explore`, `fleet`, `forget`, `history`, `install_skill`,
`install_source`,
`list_sessions`, `list_subagents`, `lsp_definition`, `lsp_diagnostics`, `lsp_hover`,
`lsp_references`, `memory`, `parallel_tasks`, `read_only_skill`,
`read_only_task`, `read_session`, `read_skill`, `read_subagent_result`, `remember`, `research`,
`review`, `run_skill`, `security_review`, `slash_command`, `task`.

`parallel_tasks` and `fleet` keep their combined result below the single-tool
output limit by returning a fair preview and a stable `Subagent reference` for
every persisted child. `read_subagent_result` pages through one referenced
final answer by UTF-8 byte offset, so long parallel research remains lossless
without injecting every report into the parent context at once. `list_subagents`
recovers the references themselves when the aggregate that carried them never
arrived, which is what an interrupted background fleet leaves behind. References
are restricted to the current conversation lineage and workspace.

`use_capability` (`action` = `list` | `inspect` | `call` | `decline`) is on the
provider-visible surface for every execution setting (`light` | `balanced` |
`delivery`). Optional tools stay registered for host dispatch but are not
expanded into the top-level provider schema; the model reaches them through
`use_capability` without cache-breaking schema churn.

`internal/assembly/boot.TestBootToolContractMatchesProviderVisibleSurface` verifies the
actual boot registry contract against the provider request, including read-only
flags and canonical schemas.

## Unified Boot Surface (all execution settings)

Every execution setting starts with the same lean provider-visible core: direct
coding tools, background-shell lifecycle tools, and the stable capability proxy:

`bash`, `bash_output`, `edit_file`, `kill_shell`, `read_file`, `wait`,
`write_file`, `compress`, `recall` and `context_budget` (when registered), and
`use_capability`.

The host-control tools ride the same surface at every setting: `todo_write` and
`complete_step` for the task list, and `ask` and `await_user` for the turns that
end on the model's terms. `conclude_blocked` is registered but not yet on this
surface, so it is reachable only through `use_capability` even where the host
names it as a way out of an unfinished turn.

Optional tools (`glob`, `grep`, `ls`, `web_fetch`, MCP, skills, subagents, docs,
session history, memory mutation, workflow, and so on) remain in the host
registry for dispatch. The model lists, inspects, calls, or declines them via
`use_capability` without changing the provider tool list. Execution settings change
host planning / verification / review policy, not which tools appear on the
provider-visible surface. The retired `connect_tool_source` path is no longer
registered.
