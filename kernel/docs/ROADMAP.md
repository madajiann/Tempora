# Tempora 2.x roadmap

## Purpose

This page tracks what Tempora 2.x still has to deliver, how it ships, and which decisions are still open.

- Why there are two release lines: the [version roadmap announcement](https://github.com/esengine/DeepSeek-Tempora/discussions/10748).
- How to move between them: [Moving from 1.x to 2.x](./MIGRATING.md).

## Release lines

| Line | Branch | Status | Ships |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2.x | `studio` | Active development | Tempora Studio and the `tempora` CLI, from `studio-v2.*` tags |
| 1.x | `main-v2` | Maintenance / stable | The 1.x desktop app. The last 1.x CLI on npm and Homebrew is 1.39.0. |

## How 2.x ships

| ID | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| R1 | A `studio-v2.*` tag builds Studio for macOS, Windows and Linux, and `tempora` CLI archives for `darwin`, `linux` and `windows` on `amd64` and `arm64` (`.github/workflows/release-studio.yml`). |
| R2 | Studio updates itself in place from the release it was installed from ([Studio release runbook](./STUDIO_RELEASE.md)). |
| R3 | The same release publishes the CLI to npm and to the `esengine/tempora` Homebrew tap. A stable version such as `2.21.0` moves npm `latest`; a candidate skips Homebrew. |
| R4 | 1.x no longer publishes the CLI to npm, Homebrew or the CLI update pointers. |
| R5 | The next stable `studio-v2.*` release MUST NOT be tagged until every gate in [General availability](#general-availability) is met, because R3 makes it the release that moves `npm i -g tempora` and `brew install` from 1.x to 2.x. |
| R6 | Planned, not in place: stable releases follow a weekly train. Builds publish to npm `next` as they land, and one fixed day each week promotes the previous week's `next` to `latest` unless a P0 or P1 regression is open. Today every stable tag moves `latest` at once. |
| R7 | Planned, not in place: Studio offers a `stable` and a `latest` update channel that follow the same two tags. |

## General availability

2.x leaves pre-release in the same stable release that moves npm and Homebrew to it. Every gate MUST hold first.

| ID | Gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | Every row of [Terminal takeover](#terminal-takeover) is done | Open |
| G2 | W1a and W1b are done, so a person moving from npm 1.x finds their conversations in 2.x | Met |
| G3 | Session and config formats carry a version and a migration path, and are frozen for the 2.x line | Open |
| G4 | Two consecutive weeks of `next` builds with no open P0 or P1 issue | Open |
| G5 | Every porting-list row marked required (W3) is done | Open |
| G6 | Signed, self-updating builds on macOS, Windows and Linux | Met |

## Terminal takeover

The 2.x terminal UI (`tempora tui`) replaces the 1.x chat screen for people who work in a terminal.

| ID | Item | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | Terminal UI on the in-process kernel: streaming, approvals, questions, queue and steer, `!` shell commands, completion, task list | Done |
| T2 | Look and keys of the 1.x chat screen: banner, framed composer, mode tag, footer telemetry, per-request usage, approval and question panels, i18n | Done |
| T3 | Full screen by default with scrollbar, wheel, drag-select copy, `/mouse`; `--inline` for the terminal's own scrollback | Done |
| T4 | `-r` session picker and `/resume`; system notifications; Ctrl+B for long shell output | Done |
| T5 | Ctrl+V pastes a screenshot (Alt+V on Windows) | Done |
| T6 | Bare `tempora`, `tempora -c` and `tempora -r` start the terminal UI, as they do in 1.x, with 1.x's session options and permission-mode names | Done |
| T7 | Windows checks by hand: IME candidate window position, Alt+V image paste | Not started |
| T8 | Local install test of the npm package and the Homebrew cask before the switch release | Not started |
| T9 | `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` name npm and Homebrew as the 2.x CLI channels in the switch release | Not started |

## Other workstreams

| ID | Item | Line | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| W1a | 2.x opens sessions 1.x 1.38.2 to 1.38.7 saved (event log schema 2), and continues them in a 2.x session | 2.x | Done |
| W1b | 2.x lists and opens sessions 1.x 1.38.8 or later keep in `sessions-v4`; see [Sessions](./MIGRATING.md#sessions) | 2.x | Done |
| W2 | 1.x stops listing the `.wire.jsonl`, `.adjudication.jsonl` and `.execution.jsonl` files 2.x writes as conversations | 1.x | In review: #10767 |
| W3 | 1.x to 2.x porting list: 1.x fixes, tests and behavior, each marked ported, reimplemented or not carried over | Both | Not started |
| W4 | 2.x contribution and architecture review rules in `CONTRIBUTING.md` | 2.x | Partly done: branch table, dependency direction and cache-first review gate exist |
| W5 | Version note in the 1.x `README.md` on `main-v2` | 1.x | Not started |

## 1.x maintenance

| ID | Rule | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | 1.x takes bug fixes, security fixes and provider or API compatibility only. It gets no new features and no new session, config or storage formats. | Proposed, needs agreement with the 1.x maintainers |
| M2 | 1.x maintenance ends 3 months after 2.x general availability, or on a fixed backstop date, whichever comes first. | Proposed |
| M3 | The backstop date is set by @esengine and published in the version announcement. | Open |
| M4 | A fix that matters on both lines lands on `main-v2` and is recorded in the porting list (W3). | Active |

## Open decisions

These are decided by @esengine and recorded here when made.

| ID | Decision | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | The backstop date that ends 1.x maintenance (M2, M3) | Open |
| D2 | Agreement with the 1.x maintainers on the feature and format freeze (M1) | Open |
