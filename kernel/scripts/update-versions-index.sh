# Merge one published release into the rollback index and print the result.
#
# The index is what lets a user go back: it lists which versions were ever
# public and where each one's immutable manifest lives. It deliberately does NOT
# copy asset URLs or signatures — an entry points at <tag>/latest.json, so a
# rollback download verifies through exactly the same path as a forward update
# and there is never a second source of truth for what an artifact should be.
#
# Merging is additive: an existing entry for the same version wins, so a rerun
# or a recovery publication can never rewrite history. Usage:
#
#   update-versions-index.sh <existing-index|-> <version> <tag> <channel> <published-at> [keep]
