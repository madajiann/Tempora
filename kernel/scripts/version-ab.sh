# The harness, the task set and the grader all come from the working tree; only
# the agent binary differs between arms. What makes this experiment fragile is
# that an older binary reads its configuration differently — v1.0.0 has no
# --auto flag, ignores TEMPORA_HOME, and resolves the API key from the process
# environment rather than the credential store. Each of those produces a
# quietly different experiment instead of a failure, so they are asserted here
# rather than discovered halfway through a run.
