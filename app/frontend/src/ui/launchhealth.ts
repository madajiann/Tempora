 *  That sentence is what retires the update the launch booted from. The swap is
 *  performed by a process that cannot judge the result, so the rollback
 *  material is kept until the application that came up reports in — and nothing
 *  in this tree reported. The endpoint existed with no caller, so the
 *  transaction was never closed and every install after the first refused: a
 *  pending update already exists.
 *
 *  Said from the page rather than the shell because a window that opened and
 *  then failed to render is exactly the case the rollback exists for, and only
 *  the page knows it got past that. Silent either way: nothing here was asked
 *  for by anyone, and a launch that booted from no update has nothing to retire.
